# Basic CSS example

This directory contains 3 files: this readme, a file called `index.html`, and a file called `styles.css`. Together, these files will display a styled version of the [Basics of HTML example](https://github.com/byu-is-403/syllabus/tree/master/html-css-bootstrap/examples/html-basics).

To use this demo locally, either download the files into a directory or copy their contents into two files called `index.html` and `styles.css`. Then double click `index.html` to open it in your default browser.
