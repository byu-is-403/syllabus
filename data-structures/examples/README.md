# Data structures examples

These examples will help you understand how to use certain data structures in C#. You have two choices to run this code: via .NET Core, or through Visual Studio.

## .NET Core

.NET core is available across all platforms (yes, that means Mac and Linux!). No matter what platform you are on, make sure you have completed steps 1 and 2 from the [getting started guide](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#macos).

Once the .NET command line tools are installed, navigate to the folder containing `Program.cs` and run the following commands:

```shell
dotnet restore
```

```shell
dotnet run
```

You will see the program's output in the console.

## Visual Studio

If you would like to run the code here with visual studio, you are probably best off copying and pasting the sample code into a new project and running it as you would any other console application.
