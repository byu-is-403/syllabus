# Data Structures Basics Assignment

Your task is to create a program that will help you familiarize yourself with various data structures available in the C# language.

You are the owner of a very successful hamburger restaurant. Your faithful customers line up every day and eat dozens of burgers. You are writing a program to track exactly how many hamburgers each customer eats.


## Requirements

Create a new C# Console Application. In the `Main` function, add a new variable of type `Queue` that contains items of type `string`.


* Create a variable for a `Queue` with items of type `string`
  - This variable will represent your line of customers waiting outside.
* Create a variable for a `Dictionary` with keys of type `string` and values of type `int`.
  - This variable will hold information about each customer
* Put 100 customers into the queue
  - You can use the `randomName` function below to generate random people for your line
* Add a random number of burgers to the total for each customer. Make sure there is a key in the dictionary for each customer before you try incrementing their total!
* Print out each customer and their total burgers eaten.


### Sample Output

Your output will look something like this:

```
Greg Anderson                 131
John Miller                   137
Emily Bell                    148
Ann Rose                      149
Carol Roche                   233
Arthur McKinney               111
Joann Fisher                  72
Dan Morain                    65
```


### Resources

Here is some code that will help you with this project. Paste it into your `Program` class above your `Main` function.

```csharp
public static Random random = new Random();

public static string randomName() {
    string[] names = new string[8]{"Dan Morain", "Emily Bell", "Carol Roche", "Ann Rose", "John Miller", "Greg Anderson", "Arthur McKinney", "Joann Fisher"};
    int randomIndex = Convert.ToInt32(random.NextDouble() * 7);
    return names[randomIndex];
}

public static int randomNumberInRange() {
    return Convert.ToInt32(random.NextDouble() * 20);
}
```


## Guide

First, add the `randomName` and `randomNumberInRange` functions above to your program. Then, create a new queue of strings and a dictionary with `string` keys and `int` values.

You need to add 100 customers to your queue using the `Enqueue` method. Remember you can use `randomName` to generate a random customer name.

Next, we need to _iterate_ over the customers in the queue. This can be done in a number of different ways:

* Use the `Dequeue` method to remove customers from the queue one by one
* Use a `foreach` loop to iterate over the items in the collections
* Use an _enumerator_ like so:

```csharp
IEnumerator MyQueueEnumerator = qMyQueue.GetEnumerator();

while (MyQueueEnumerator.MoveNext())
{
  ...
}
```

> **Note**: IEnumerator is used to get the values of lists, where the length is not necessarily known ahead of time (even though it could be).

As you iterate through your customers, you should keep track of how many burgers they are ordering. If a customer's name does not yet exist as a key in the dictionary you created, you will need to create a new entry with a starting value of 0. Then, add a random number to their value each time they appear in the list (you can use the provided `randomNumberInRange` function).

If you are using the provided `randomName` function, you will encounter the same customer multiple times. Make sure your code increments the number of burgers ordered each time (hint: use `+=`).

Once you have iterated over all the customers in the queue, you need to print their name and the total number of burgers consumed. Do this by iterating over your dictionary. Again, there are many ways to accomplish this; you can choose to do it any way as long as your output resembles the sample output above.
