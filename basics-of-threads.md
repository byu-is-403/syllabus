## What are Threads?

A _thread_ is a process moving through time. Threads supply the hardware with information; think of it as the 'road' by which the information gets into the CPU core. Every application uses at least one thread. Used correctly, threads can improve performance by separating computations across multiple logical processors. Used incorrectly, however, they can hinder performance.

In a GUI C# application, the UI thread is created automatically and is used by the application when executed. Attempts to access form controls from threads other than the UI thread will cause a cross-thread exception; all of the UI operations are queued in that thread. Every command executed in the `Main` method is executed in the primary or UI thread which ends when `Main` ends.

_Multi-threading_ is the use of more than one thread. While multi-threading helps increase responsiveness, it also increases the chance for a deadlock. Thread execution is a low-level task that is schedule by the operating systems. There is no guarantee that multiple threads will run across multiple processors; in systems with a single processor, multiple threads take turns running. On multi-processor systems, it is hoped that the operating system assigns different threads to different processors. Multi-processing has a downside of complexity (scheduling, sharing of resources, timing, etc.).

In C#, `System.Threading` provides different thread types; e.g. a `Timer` object is really a thread.


## Using Threads

1. Include `System.Threading`
2. Create your threads
3. Start the threads
4. Join the threads

```csharp
{
  thread.start();

  // ... stuff you want to do while the other thread is busy doing its own thing concurrently

  thread.join();

  // ... you won't get here until thread has terminated.
}
```

5. Write the methods called by the Thread constructor and are executed during the running of the thread


## Life Cycle of Threads

- **Un-started State**: the thread is created but has not been started
- **Ready State (Running)**: thread is ready to run and waiting for the CPU cycle
- **Not Runnable State (Wait, Sleep, Join)**: the thread is not executable because the Sleep or Wait methods have been called or it is (Blocked) being blocked by other I/O operations
- **Dead State(Stopped)**: thread execution is aborted or has been completed
- **Suspend**: Paused by program and waiting for command to resume


## Thread Methods and Code

- **Start**: starts the thread
- **Abort**: begins the process of terminating the thread
- **Join**: blocks the calling thread until a thread terminates or enables us to wait until a thread completes
- **Sleep**: causes the thread to wait a specified number of milliseconds
- **Yield**: causes a thread to yield execution to another thread that is ready to run on the current processor (controlled by the operating system)

```csharp
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks; // Provides access to the Thread class


Thread thread1 = new Thread(new ThreadStart(A)); // Creates a new thread object called thread1 and tells the system that when it starts it will use the A method found in the source code

thread1.Start(); // Starts the execution of the thread and in this case will call the A method

thread1.Join(); // Run the thread until it has completed but still run other processes also

static void thread1Starter() {
  for (int iCount = 0; iCount < 100; iCount++) {
      Console.WriteLine("A " + Convert.ToString(iCount));
  }
}

// This is the method that the thread will keep executing

```

## Using Multi-Threads

You **MAY** want to multi-thread if...
* a particular piece of code takes a long time to complete
* you can run code parallel
* you are waiting a long time for File I/O to complete or respond

You may **NOT** want to multi-thread if...
* you are using them just because they sound cool
* you haven't proven that a single threaded implementation is slow
* you don't understand them (can cause app freezes, resource exhaustion, etc, that are hard to debug)


## Hyper-threading

Some processors, like the i7-2600K, have hyper-threading. This is where each core can take 2 threads. In layman's terms, although the CPU has 4 physical cores, it allows the CPU to act as if it had 8 cores. Generally only useful for high-intensity program that do modelling or video-editing work. Cores donâ€™t share memory because they have their own dedicated memory 1 core 1 thread, so the processing time is still faster than the 4cores with 4 threads, than the dual cores with 4 threads.
